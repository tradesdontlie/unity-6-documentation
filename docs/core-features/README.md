# Core Features of Unity 6

Unity 6 introduces several groundbreaking features and improvements that enhance game development workflow, performance, and visual quality.

## Entity Component System (ECS)

Unity 6 features a fully integrated Entity Component System architecture, designed for high-performance, data-oriented programming.

### Key Benefits
- **Performance**: Optimized for modern CPU architectures with improved cache utilization
- **Scalability**: Better handling of large numbers of game objects
- **Multithreading**: Efficient utilization of multi-core processors
- **Memory Efficiency**: Reduced memory overhead compared to traditional GameObject approach

### Basic ECS Concepts
- **Entities**: Lightweight identifiers (essentially IDs)
- **Components**: Pure data containers with no behavior
- **Systems**: Logic that processes entities with specific component combinations
